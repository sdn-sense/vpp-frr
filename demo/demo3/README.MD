1. Go to SENSE-O to create SENSE path: NRP-CERN-TO-VPP-FABRIC
2. Go back to slides and show diagram on what it creates;
3. I will skip pod creation for now - as will show case how we can do a BGP peering and launch public ranges. This is very similar to previous demo between two nodes, while in this case it is between Fabric VPP Slice and NRP CERN Node;
4. Enable Real time monitoring, issue ping;
5. Ping requests
6. Jump to demo4;
